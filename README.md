Julia Repository for DL-Driven solutions to Inverse Problems


To address the elephant in the room, this is not a Julia package.
If anything, this repository houses a set of scripts that I try to automate as much as possible, to enable reproducibility.
That said, the work here shall be converted to reusable library standard code when time permits. But this is not my priority.

If you are new to Julia, there are somethings that you have to do first.
    - Install Julia
    - Install a VS Code extension to Julia (If you use another editor, explore and install the corresponding Julia extension.)

Then you are in good shape to start reproducing this code.
    - Instantiate the current development environment in Julia.
        - To do so: 
            - Press "]" on the Julia REPL
            - Type activate . (while you are in the cloned repository.)
        - This should fetch all the dependencies for the work here.
